Monopolie 0.9.8b
--No date yet

SM:  Major code overhaul.  A few fundamental changes.

Fixed/Added
  + Selecting "unowned properties" not written, but will no longer
    cause the game to crash
  + Abstracted out human/CPU players to their own subclasses, based
    on an interface class "claIPlayer"
  + Removed use of arrays from property classes
  + Improved AI functions - should be easier to work on now.
    All CPU AI functions are in a seperate modCPU module.
  + TurnManager has been moved into a "PlayerManager" class.
  + Fixed bug where players could mortgage a CPU player property.
  + Added trading functionality
  + Overhaul of logging system - much more informative
  + Improved logging functionality
  + CPU players will mortgage unimproved property when they are short of cash
  + CPU players will improve properties when they own full sets and can afford to
  + "House rules" advanced options now actually work in the game

Behind the scenes:
  + Tidied up some code indentation.
  + Tidied up some IF statements.
  + Removed some (well ... a lot of) redundant code.
  + Removed recursive use of "PlayersTurn" to prevent stack overflows
    while testing CPU AI module.
  + Tidied up some dialogs.  Should be able to call a "run" method
    for the dialogs, rather than having "form.show" and "unload form"
    all through the code.
  + Began moving property & rent details into an INI file.
  + Removed use of confusing Arrays for Properties (and added confusing
    use of classes instead :)  )
  + Major code tidying - cleaned up indexes, code structures, etc.
  + Improved Victory condition checks
    
Code queries:
  + frmHousing.GetPropertyNumbers looks like a duplicate of
    claProperties.GetPropertyNumbers.  Was there a reason this was
    done that way?
  + PlayerCoords has an array called "MoveIndices".  Can't we just
    take the board location the player needs and use mod 40 to find
    the correct square?
  + Token coords is a 0 based array, but is declared up to a size
    of 40.  This makes 41 squares (I.E:  the GO coords are in there
    twice).  Was there a reason for this?
    
Monopoie 0.9.8
--No Date Yet (In Development)

Fixed/Added
  +Reworked GUI to have SideMenu rather than on the bottom uses the control from VBAccelerator
  +Interface is now MDI rather than SDI
  +Updated Comm/Chance so it autocloses
  +Put tooltips for property name, owner
  +Rolldice unavailable until a human player is up
  +The cmdbutton does not show 10% for the tax screen as it did in 0.9.7--(My bad)
  +Comm/Chance executes when you close form rather than in the background.
  +Sound now uses API!!!!!
  +$50 charge after in jail 3 times w/o rolling doubles

  +You can begin a new game w/o closing Monopolie
  +The Chance Card now takes out 2 times railroad rent
  +Chance advance to Util now works--but see below
  +Double Rent if player lands on an undeveloped property that is part of a monopoly
  +You can no longer mortgage a property if other properties in the same color group have been developed
  +Save File Works it Converts the Player Info, Property Info to hex then writes it to the file 
    This is to prevent casual editing...we propably need to perform some kind of checksum?
  +Computer will declare bankrupt if it has no money to pay rent support needs to be added so that it will mortgage property when available--Part of the AI
  +New game resets pieces to start position.
  +Reformatted the Rules--Saved as RTF
  +Added frmRules
  +Fixed bug where you got to go again when getting out of jail by rolling doubles
  +Fixed bug when in Jail it rolled again to see how many spaces to move
  +Fixed bug that allowed Negative Values--(Finally I think!?!)
  +Added Comments to SourceCode--Hopefully I have explained what I am doing with the code ;)
    Not Finished yet but will continue to add them--Tried to be acurate when labeling the author if unknown left blank, Authors, Please fill in the Procedures you helped code.

Known Bugs:
  +SM:  If the CPU player buys a property, the player can instantly mortgage it
        while the dialog is still active.
  +Not 10x rent when Chance Card advance to Utility
  +When a Property is mortgaged you can buy or sell a house that does not exist
  +Buy Houses on Properties with Two Properties not updating buttons Correctly
  +Card does not dissappear after paying rent to other player.
  +Game crashes when attempting to see unowned properties.

ToDo:
  +SM:  Double-clicks on frmViewTrade should display property details
  +SM:  claTrade.execute needs to be written
  +SM:  Consensus - should Money be LONG, or INTEGER?
  +Would like to convert some of the Arrays to UserDefinedTyes
  +AI
  +Cap Houses owned at 32 and Hotels at 12 per the rules
  +Bankruptcy gives properties to other player/bank
  +Non-Standard Rules-Free Parking

  +OptionsForm for Non-Standard Gameplay
  +ToolTips to contain Rent?
